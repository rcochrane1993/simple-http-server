1 the fs core module is important in development because it si the built-in "file system" for node
and contains modules(or libraries) that are imported into a file. the fs allows us to access
the file system.

2. sync methods will not execute until the previous line of code has executed, while
non-sync methods do not wait for the previous line of code to execute before running.
3. modules are useful because they allow us to add libraries for use in our code.
4. server-side languages require a way to acces the file system through code, and the 
fs system allows us to do that.
